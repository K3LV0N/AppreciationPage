    text: `Hi Taryn,\n
    On behalf of myself and everyone in our training group, I’d like to sincerely thank you for all the hard work and dedication you’ve put into supporting us during our time at Cognizant!\n
    As you know, I was allocated to my client project during training while also serving as batch representative (which meant balancing quite a few extra responsibilities and stressors). Despite that, every session with you was clear, well-structured, and easy to follow. I truly appreciated the way you made complex concepts simple and approachable, and I’m especially grateful for the many times you went out of your way to help me personally with my code or other issues when I was handling multiple different commitments.\n
    I can honestly say I’ve never had such a supportive and caring instructor. Many others simply follow the set curriculum, but you went above and beyond to make sure no one was left behind. That level of care and commitment made a huge difference for all of us (especially me), and I deeply admire and applaud you for it!\n
    Once again, thank you for being such a wonderful instructor. I can only hope future new hires get to learn from you too. They’ll be lucky to have you!\n
    Warmest regards,
    Kyle Norman`,

I really admire you spending the time and energy to make sure "no soldier is left behind"(like your teacher used to say) and also the small questions at the beginning of each meeting really make the whole experience significantly better! Thanks again for advocating and caring for us and I hope one day to be able to mentor youngins just like you did :D\n
    Hope to see/meet you in Dallas soon!!`,

    I just wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you for the incredible training and support you’ve provided over the past few months. As a new graduate stepping into my first professional role, I was understandably nervous and unsure of what to expect. Your guidance has made all the difference.\n
    Your training sessions were not only informative but also empowering. You helped bridge the gap between academic knowledge and real world application, and thanks to your patience and clarity, I now feel confident in my ability to deliver high-quality work to our client. I especially appreciate how you always made time for one on one troubleshooting, no matter how busy things got, it truly meant a lot.\n
    Your dedication, kindness, and expertise have left a lasting impression, and I feel fortunate to have learned from you. Wishing you continued success and all the best in your future endeavors!\n
    Warm regards, Haadi`,
